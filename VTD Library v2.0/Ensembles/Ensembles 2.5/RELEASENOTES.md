Release Notes
=============

2.5
---
- Added support for the Dropbox v2 API. The new class `CDEDropboxV2CloudFileSystem` has been introduced. It is compatible with the cloud files of the v1 API, but will require the user to login again.
- Introduced non-critical, informative errors (`nonCriticalErrorCodes` property). These do not cause a failure, but can be useful to the app. An example is when an unknown model is found in the cloud. This can be a good indication that the user should be encouraged to upgrade to the latest version.
- Simple Sync in Swift example is now in Swift 3.
- Fix for issues when using a non-standard root directory with the CloudKit backend.
- Fixes for various memory issues related to autoreleasing error arguments, which only arose in the latest OSes.
- The Ensembles Resources are now a dependency of the iOS static library, to ensure the bundle gets built.

2.4.2
---
- You can now set a root directory for Dropbox storage.
- Setting added to Dropbox class that can be used to avoid hitting 10000 file limit. It introduces subfolders to do this.
- Fixed issue with Dropbox when removing files could sometimes 'choke' the SDK. Now batched.
- Removed Dropbox Sync backend.
- Improved progress updates when exporting event files.
- Improved multipeer backend, with file-available notifications that can be used for more immediate syncing.
- Added a tvOS framework target.
- Fixed memory related crash due to overreleasing of an NSError in CDEEventIntegrator.

2.4.1
---
- Progress is now reported during downloading and uploading of files.
- Fixed a bug that could cause sync to fail, and even prevent new data being added, on devices 'left behind' by rebasing.
- Rebasing cleans up more data, and is more easily triggered by excessive data.
- Added target to build a universal module for iOS.
- Node backend will upload and download files in batches for better performance.
- Added `CDEMonitoredManagedObjectContextSaveChangesWereStoredNotification`, so you can know when Ensembles finishes storing data.
- Added check for `CKErrorUserDeletedZone` error, and recreate the zone.
- Updated file removal in CloudKit to explicitly remove each file. Were using automatic deletion, but that has a limit of 700 files.

2.4
---
- Updated settings to have bitcode generated in all release builds.
- Added support using a custom zone with CloudKit backend. This allows for atomic transactions, which may be more stable, and faster. Adopt the new initializer to use it.
- Introduced a new schema for CloudKit, and moved from query-based fetches to change-based fetches. Much faster, but only for the private database. Use the new initializer for this.
- Added batching for deletions with CloudKit. There is a limit of 400 items, and so for large deletions, it was possible to hit this limit.
- Changed Quality of Service for all CloudKit operations to user-initiated. Anything less can stall.
- Found a few places in CloudKit backend where the convenience methods were used. These no doubt default to the background QoS, so they have also been replaced to prevent stalls.
- Added CloudKit as an option in Idiomatic.
- Changed Quality of Service to user-initiated in other parts of the framework.
- Changed default size of batches for uploads and downloads with Dropbox Core to one. It seems to generate errors sometimes with multiple requests.
- Reduced excessive prefetching that could cause memory blowup for large stores.
- Made merges a lot faster when all new changes are from the local device.
- Changes for ordered relationships to avoid internal exceptions in Core Data.
- Added Simple Sync in Swift example.

2.3.3
---
- Added more missing Quality-of-Service settings in CloudKit backend.
- Renamed schemes.
- Added an iOS framework and module target.
- Better support for Swift with nullability and generics annotations.
- Fixed bug where a migration which adds a property could lead to lost data in rebasing or baseline consolidation.
- Fixed bug that could cause relationships to be left unset in models with inherited relationships.
- Updated RNCryptor for the encrypted backend.

2.3.2
---
- Changed the `storeURL` property name to `persistentStoreURL`. Will require updating in any calling code.
- Added `dismantle` method for `CDEPersistentStoreEnsemble`. If you want to stop using an ensemble (eg after it is deleeched), you can use this method to ensure it does not hang around causing side effects. The method stops the ensemble using data on the disk, and monitoring saves. It is also useful if you want to replace one ensemble object with another.
- Related to dismantling, there are now checks to make sure that when an ensemble is created, it does not share any disk data with another ensemble. Accidentally doing this could lead to unexpected bugs. This problem would typically arise if you tried to destroy one ensemble, and replace it with another.
- Added Quality of Service settings to all operation queues, to ensure they keep working even on mobile networks
- Set the Quality of Service of CloudKit operations. It was defaulting to 'background', causing stalling when off WiFi

2.3.1
---
- Fixed bug in `CDECloudKitFileSystem` that could cause files not to be removed, and accumlate, slowing sync and increasing cloud storage.
- Fixed the `CDESeedPolicyExcludeLocalData` option. Was not working after recent changes to dependency handling.
- Added `soundName` setting to CloudKit subscription to workaround a bug in which notifications don't fire on iOS 8.
- Changed Idiomatic for iOS to use the Dropbox Core API, rather than the Sync API. The Sync API is deprecated and will stop working in October, 2015.
- Added the new merge option `CDEMergeOptionsSuppressCloudFileDeposition`. This prevents uploading of data to the cloud. Can be used when responding to push notifications to prevent ping-ponging between devices. 
- Improved efficiency of Dropbox Core backend, by supporting simulataneous upload, download, and removal of multiple files.
- Fixed a retain cycle which would cause a `CDEPersistentStoreEnsemble` to linger after being released.
- Updated for Xcode 7, including Bitcode.
- SSZipArchive seems to have been deprecated and removed from the original GitHub repo. If you need it, you can use this version: https://github.com/mentalfaculty/SSZipArchive

2.3
---
- Missing files will not not cause a merge to fail. This solves the issue that a device with half uploaded files could go offline for a long time, leaving the remaining devices wedged and unable to sync. The other devices will now continue to sync, ignoring the half-complete files until all files have appeared.
- Fixed a threading bug that could affect ordered-relationships.
- There is now a property that allows compressed hashes to be used in the cloud data. This can save some storage. It is off by default.
- Added a test that generates a random sync history.
- Mention Swift in the README.
