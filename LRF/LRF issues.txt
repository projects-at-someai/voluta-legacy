L and P mode. you recall, of course, that we really have P and L mode upright, meaning usually being bumped about and registering something with accelerometer. However, in L mode flat, and a bit in P mode, I have on two ipads before me the screen art not loading correctly. The black bar is present. If i just slide a finger under the ipad to pick it up, or 'bump' it, the proper L mode artwork loads properly. Then, in P Flat mode, the L mode artwork was still hanging, so I bumped it and P mode art showed up. I've been testing features and hadn't quite got to full L mode testing. I think L mode features are solid, but we had this flat/upright or 'in motion' problem before. I won't include screen caps unless you want because you''ve fixed this before.
